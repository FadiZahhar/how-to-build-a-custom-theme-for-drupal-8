# [How to Build a Custom Theme for Drupal 8][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Drupal is a CMS (content management system) that allows you to quickly and easily create content-driven sites for yourself and customers. Lucky for us, Drupal is a great tool that we can use over and over again and almost never see the same site twice. But therein lies the problem. How can we give our customers web sites and designs that meet their specific needs when none of the existing themes are quite right? That is where custom themes come into play.

In this course, you'll learn how to create your own Drupal themes. With some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can easily create fully customized Drupal-powered web sites for our customers. Follow along and you'll be creating your own custom Drupal theme in no time.
